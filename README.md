# Lightsaber-Antimatter

My Lightsaber [Antimatter] is the third and most recent prototype of my special-fx lightsaber design.

The saber consists of two circuit boards, one with an esp-32 that controls leds that run the length of the blade, gathers readings from a gyroscope, manages a single cell battery, communicates with an iphone via bluetooth, and gathers readings from 4 VL53L5CX ToF sensors located on the second circuit board.
